## COMPILE

make

Needs the path to GSL and CUBA libraries in the Makefile

## RUN CODE

./compute_RR param.txt

## IN PARAMETER FILE

- dndrfile1
First dndr(r) [also called p(r) in Breton & de la Torre 2020] file, an ascii file with two row : r, dndr(r)
dndr(r) is not necessarily normalised. However the limits of r MUST ABSOLUTELY match the one of the survey.

- dndrfile2
Second dndr(r) file. For auto-correlation this is the same as -dndrfile1
The limits in r in dndrfile2 are used as limits for the second random for cross-correlation (for most purposes, it should match the limits in dndrfile1).

-wformat
Give the input format of -wfile. Must be 'standard' or 'polspice'. In both cases wfile is an ascii file.
'standard', two columns: theta, w(theta)  ! theta must be in radians and increasing
'polspice', three columns: theta, cos(theta), w(theta)  ! Warning, theta must be decreasing (start from pi and end with zero)

- wfile
The w(theta) file for the angular correlation function of the angular survey weights, with the format given by -wformat

- W0_1
Average of the survey angular weights over the full sky (accounting for zeros in masked regions)
In the DR case we need the average of the galaxy counts map.

- W0_2
Same as W0_1, but for the random part.

- W1W2
This is the average of the W1 x W2 maps. The resul is used to set the angular correlation function at w(0).

- smin
Minimum correlation scale, in Mpc/h

- smax
Maximum correlation scale, in Mpc/h

- ns
Number of radial bins for the correlation function

- nmu
Number of angular bins for the correlation function
If nmu > 0 : Computes the RR counts for each (s, mu) bins with Eq.(12) of Breton & de la Torre (2020)
Else : Compute the RR multipoles with Eq.(14)

- angle
Angle definition, must be "end" for end-point definition, or "mid" for mid-point definition

- integration
Integration type, must be "gsl" for gsl integrations (using cquad), "vegas", "suave", "divonne" or "cuhre" 
for the associated integration functions from the CUBA library

- eps_rel
Relative error associated with the integrations above (note that for gsl, this will be the error on each integrals, while for CUBA integration this is the final error on the full integration).

- output_base
This is the base for the output name, which is automatically completed with "angle", "integration" and "eps_rel".

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Ascii files, 
For RR(s,mu) we have with six columns : smin, smax, mu_min, mu_max, RR (mu < 0), RR (mu > 0)
For RR multipoles we have eleven columns : smin, smax, R_0, R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5, R_6, R_7, R_8 
The RR are normalised so that the total number of randoms in the sample is 1 (to compare to the RR from pair-counting one must therefore multiply the RR by NÂ² with N the number of objects in the sample)
