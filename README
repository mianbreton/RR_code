## COMPILATION

First, need to set the path to GSL and CUBA libraries in the Makefile. Then run:
> make

## TO RUN CODE

> ./compute_RR param.txt

## PARAMETER FILE

- dndrfile1
First dndr(r) [also called p(r) in Breton & de la Torre 2020] file, i.e. an ASCII file with two rows: r, dndr(r).
dndr(r) does not need to be normalized. However, the limits on r MUST ABSOLUTELY match the one of the survey, i.e.
the first and last rows in this file sets the r_min and r_max of the survey radial selection function.

- dndrfile2
Second dndr(r) file. For RR pairs calculation this should be the same as dndrfile1. The limits in r in dndrfile2
are used as limits for the random selection function in the DR case (for most purposes, it should
match the limits in dndrfile1).

- wformat
The input format of wfile. Can be 'standard' or 'polspice'. In both cases, wfile is an ASCII file.
'standard' format -> two columns: theta, w(theta) ! Warning, theta must be in radians and increasing
'polspice' format -> three columns: theta, cos(theta), w(theta) ! Warning, theta must be decreasing (start from pi 
and end with zero)

- wfile
The w(theta) file for the angular correlation function of the angular survey selection fonction, with format given
in wformat.

- W0_1
Average of the survey angular selection function over the full sky (accounting for zeros in masked regions). In the 
DR case, this should be the average of the galaxy counts map.

- W0_2
Same as W0_1, but for the randoms. For RR pairs calculation the value should be the same as W0_1.

- W1W2
Average of the W1 x W2 map. This value is used to normalize the amplitude of the correlation function of the survey 
angular selection function. For RR pairs calculation, this should be the average of W1^2 over the pixels of the map 
(W1 is the angular selection map).

- smin
Minimum correlation function scale in Mpc/h

- smax
Maximum correlation function scale in Mpc/h

- ns
Number of bins in s between smin and smax in the anisotropic correlation function

- nmu
Number of bins in mu in the anisotropic correlation function. If nmu>0, RR pair counts are computed in each (s, mu)
bin using Eq.(12) of Breton & de la Torre (2020), else RR multipole moments are computed using Eq.(14). When nmu<=0,
the associated absolute value gives the number of multipole moments to be computed. There are 3 possibilities:
nmu=-3 computes l=0,2,4 multipoles, nmu=-5 computes l=0,2,4,6,8 multipoles, and any other value <=0 computes
l=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 multipoles.

- angle
Plane-parallel angle definition: "end" for end-point definition or "mid" for mid-point definition.

- integration
Integration type: "gsl" for gsl integration (cquad) or "vegas", "suave", "divonne", "cuhre" for the associated 
integration method in the CUBA library. "suave" method is recommended.

- eps_rel
Relative error associated with the chosen integration method above (note that for gsl, this is the error
on each integral, while for CUBA integration methods this is the error on the full integration).

- output_base
Base path for the output file name. This base is automatically completed with "angle", "integration" and "eps_rel".

## OUTPUT ASCII FILE FORMAT

For RR(s,mu) there are six columns: smin, smax, mu_min, mu_max, RR (mu < 0), RR (mu > 0)
For RR multipole moments, there are up to eleven columns: smin, smax, R_0, R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5, R_6, R_7, R_8 (or 
less R_i if the number of multipoles to be computed is smaller). RR are normalized so that the total number of random 
pairs in the sample is 1 (to compare to RR obtained from pair counting one must multiply the RR by N^2, where N 
is the number of objects in the random sample).
